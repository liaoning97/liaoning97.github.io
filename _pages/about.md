Currently, Ning Liao is a researcher focusing on **LLMs, MLLMs, MoE architecture design and agents**, and working closely with [Prof.Junchi Yan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ga230VoAAAAJ&hl=en), [Prof.Xue Yang](https://yangxue.site/) and [Dr.Xiaoxing Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=n2ewxUIAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate). 

I received my Ph.D. from Shanghai Jiao Tong University at 2024.6, and fortunately to be supervised by [Prof.Junchi Yan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ga230VoAAAAJ&hl=en). My doctoral research primarily focuses on **remote sensing, open-set recognition, and prompt learning on vision/multimodal foundation models**. I am honored to have collaborated closely with research teams during my internships at Alibaba (working with [Dr. Guoxin Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=GgqQm-MAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) and [Dr. Chenyi Lei](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wwaAIE0AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao)), Huawei Cloud (working with [Dr. Qi Tian](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=61b6eYkAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao) and [Dr. Xiaopeng Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=Ud6aBAcAAAAJ)), and Shanghai AI Laboratory (working with [Prof.Junchi Yan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ga230VoAAAAJ&hl=en)). Prior to this, I obtained my bachelor’s degree (1/106) from Xidian University at 2019.6.
