Currently, Ning Liao （廖宁） is a researcher focusing on LLMs, MLLMs, MoE architecture design and continual learning. I received my Ph.D. from Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU) at 2024.6, and fortunately to be guided by [Prof.Junchi Yan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ga230VoAAAAJ&hl=en). My doctoral research primarily focuses on remote sensing, open-set recognition, and prompt learning on vision/multimodal foundation models. I am honored to have collaborated closely with research teams during my internships at Alibaba (working with [Dr. Guoxin Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=GgqQm-MAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) and [Dr. Chenyi Lei](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wwaAIE0AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao)), Huawei Cloud (working with [Dr. Qi Tian](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=61b6eYkAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao) and [Dr. Xiaopeng Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=Ud6aBAcAAAAJ)), and Shanghai AI Laboratory (working with [Prof.Junchi Yan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ga230VoAAAAJ&hl=en)).
